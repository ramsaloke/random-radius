# Circle Generator

This is a simple React application that allows users to create circles with a random radius by clicking anywhere on the screen. The app ensures that only two circles exist at a time, and if a third circle is added, all previous circles disappear. Additionally, if the two circles intersect, the background color of the viewport changes.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate a circle at the click position with a random radius between 20px and 200px.
- Maintain a maximum of 2 circles on the screen at a time.
- Change background color when circles intersect.
- Responsive and interactive UI.
